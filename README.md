If you're following the series, I'm creating a release each week so that the state of the project at the end of a video can be marked. Each release has two numbers - a major and a minor version number - with each week being the minor version number. This means that the Week 1 project will be 0.1, Week 5 will be 0.5, Week 12 will be 0.12, etc.

The game recieves a "1.0" release upon completion.

## Building

This project was built using **GameMaker LTS 2022.0.** Other versions that come after 2022.9 will probably work.
